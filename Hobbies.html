            <spam class="txt">Cooking</spam>
            <p>Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, I started cooking when I was seven.<br>
               I also did a cooking course two years ago. I have learnt cooking quite<br>
               a wide range of food ever since. I prefer to cook food from different<br>
               cuisines, like Lasagna, Ramen, Tiramisu etc.

            <spam class="txt">Painting</spam>
            <p>Painting is my most favorite hobby. I like to do sketches and<br>
               acrylic painting the most.I have also recently started doing digital<br>
               drawing. Moreover, I sell my arts. Hit me up on instagram if you want any<br>
               certain kind of art piece.

         <li class="para11">
            <spam class="txt">Makeup</spam>
            <p>Makeup is also one of my hobbies. I started doing makeup pretty <br>
               early, as I started dancing when I was three. The first time I put <br>
               makeup on my face was when I was six; during my first performance.<br>
               And, due to that, I had to put on makeup very often. I guess overtime <br>
               I started to like doing my makeup.

            <spam class="txt">Swimming</spam>
            <p>I like swimming in my free time. It's nothing I am too passionate<br>
               about but, I find it relaxing. So, I go to swim whenever I am a bit stressed.

            <spam class="txt">Badminton</spam>
            <p>Badminton is also more like swimming instead, I don't play Badminton<br>
               when I am stressed more like when I am bored. I guess I am less of a<br>
               sporty person.
